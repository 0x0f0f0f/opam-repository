Symbolic Algorithms for Kleene algebra with Tests (KAT)

This OCaml library contains several constructions for Kleene algebra
with tests (KAT), that produce symbolic automata out of KAT
expressions, which can then be checked for equivalence using the
symbolic algorithms provided in the SAFA library.

These constructions are described in the following paper, to appear in
Proc. POPL'15:
