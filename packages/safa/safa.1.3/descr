Symbolic Algorithms for Finite Automata

This OCaml library contains symbolic algorithms for checking language
equivalence or inclusion of automata with a large alphabet, using
symbolic representations (BDDs).

It is described in the following paper, to appear in Proc. POPL'15
https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01021497v2/document

This library can be used to obtain symbolic algorithms for Kleene
algebra with tests (KAT), see library [symkat]
